Git is confusing.

This isn't working as I hoped it would. And I need to fix my email address.

Let's try this again. My history does not look the way I think it should, but I think that's because I forgot to stage the document when making my commits. Need to remember that.

Okay, I think I've corrected my email address using the use_git_config function from a few lessons ago. Time to see if it worked.
